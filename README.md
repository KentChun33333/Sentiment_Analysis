# Sentiment_Analysis

This project is used to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the Large Movie Review Dataset, sometimes known as the IMDB dataset and also on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset.

In one of the tasks, given a movie review, the model attempts to predict whether it is positive or negative. This is a binary classification task.
In another task, the model attempts to predict the sentiment from the five labels.
